# Interview Process

The goal of our interview process is to find the right person to join us
on our mission of improving quality in healthcare.

We want to get to know you and learn about your technical skills,
past work, what motivates you, and how you will raise the bar for our team.
At the same time,
we want to provide you with anything you want to know about our team,
environment, company, product, and mission.

We love data and hate bias,
so we try to structure our interview process around specific work, tasks,
and structured conversations.
We've absorbed the lessons of books like
[Thinking: Fast And Slow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0374533555)
and realize that a solid process is our best bet for making the right decision.

Start to finish,
the interview process should take 2-4 weeks,
depending on your availability.

**Stage 1**: Resume/Portfolio Review

If your resume or application doesn't have a link to a portfolio of your work (e.g. Github),
please share this when you apply, or in response to the email you
receive from us after you apply.
If your work was part of a team project,
please be clear about exactly what portions you designed.

**Stage 2**: Timed work sample

You'll receive an email from us that will contain a link to a timed work sample.
The work sample will require no more than 60 minutes
(different roles may have a lower time limit)
of your time,
and you can complete it at a time of your choosing.

**Stage 3**: 1:1 Conversation with the team lead

This Google Meet/call is mostly a "getting to know each other" conversation.
This is your opportunity to interview the team lead and learn about us.
The lead will ask a few questions about your resume or some of your portfolio work,
so that you have a chance to talk about the cool stuff you've been building.
The lead will also talk you through what our entire interview process looks like in more detail,
so that you know what to expect.

Goals for the call:

- Add some additional color/detail to the job posting about our company,
  mission, product, team, and environment.
- Give you an opportunity to interview the team lead
  so that you can determine if our team is the kind of place
  where you'd like to spend your valuable time.
- Get a sense for what sorts of things you're most excited about working on.
- Ask you for your salary expectations
  (not what you're currently making or any other trick questions).
  We need to make sure we're on the same page here
  and that we're not wasting your time.
- Prepare you for the next step in the interview process.
  We want to do everything to help you prepare
  and to be successful.
  The goal of our process is to predict success actually building software on our team.
  There are no trick questions or pop quizzes in real engineering,
  so we don't use those in our process.

**Stage 4**: Work Sample Project

We'll schedule a 3-hour block of time for you to work (remotely)
on a project similar to one you might have at PolicyStat.
It's a project that we've designed specifically for our interviewing process
that every candidate is required to complete.
The time is limited to 3 hours
because un-timed projects ask too much from candidates
and favor folks with fewer outside commitments.

You will be provided a detailed preparation guide in advance.

**Stage 5**: Meet The Team

At this point,
your work samples will have convinced us
that you've got the engineering chops we're looking for.
The last step is about a day of interviews with our team
and some cross-functional interviewers
where you'll have a chance to get to know us and ask us hard questions.
We'll also be evaluating how you'll improve our culture.

If you'll be working in one of our offices,
we prefer to do this face to face.
If you'll be working remotely,
we prefer to do this with a mix of remote and face to face,
depending on your availability.
