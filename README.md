# Make An Impact On Healthcare

[RLDatix](https://www.rldatix.com) is on a mission to change healthcare.
We help organizations drive safer, more efficient care by providing
governance, risk and compliance tools that drive overall improvement and
safety.
Our suite of cloud-based software helps organizations reduce healthcare-acquired
infections, report on adverse events, and ensure patient safety
learnings are deployed effectively and immediately through dynamic
policy and procedure management. 

RLDatix is truly global, with offices in London, Toronto, Chicago,
Fairfax, Melbourne, Adelaide, Riyadh and San Jose, allowing us to be at
the forefront of global patient safety and GRC movement.
We envision a world where patients have access to the best and safest
care possible and our team is made up of people who truly believe in
what we do.
We’re always looking for people who are passionate about making a
positive change in healthcare to join our team.

Our [PolicyStat](https://rldatix.com/en-us/products/policy-management) team helps our clients make their policies and procedures easier to find, access, and manage. Hundreds of hospitals use our SaaS application to ensure that this critical information is correct, their staff can find it, and that it supports regulatory compliance.

[More than 250,000 Americans die each year as a result of medical
error](https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/05/03/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death/).
Many of these deaths could have been prevented with existing best
practices for quality and patient safety. A hospital's best tool for
standardizing and implementing these life-saving improvements are their
written policies and procedures.
